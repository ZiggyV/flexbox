# Everyday i'm flexboxing
Some projects/ideas made in flexbox. No prefixes were given so this will only work in modern browsers. Consider a task manager like gulp to autoprefix for you.

Based on guides from [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties "A visual guide to css3 flexbox proporties") and [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ "A guide to flexbox").

The flexbox carousel javascript code is based on an article from [Nick Walsh](http://madewithenvy.com/ecosystem/articles/2015/exploring-order-flexbox-carousel/ "The Order Property: Flexbox Carousels") and refitted for my purpose.
